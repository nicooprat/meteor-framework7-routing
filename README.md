# Notes

The best way to have Meteor & F7 together would now be to use https://github.com/Akryum/meteor-vue-component (with vue-router) + https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7-Vue. Not tested yet, but looks awesome :)

# meteor-framework7-routing

Demo : http://meteor-framework7-routing.meteor.com/

This is a **very**  simple example to integrate Framework7 into Meteor routing. This repo has been created as a test case related to this issue : https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/issues/248.

## Features

It **does** support URL mapping and the swipe back feature from Framework7.

It **doesn't** properly support back/forward browser buttons (content always come from right) and different header contents.

## Notice

Iron Router is used here, but you can use whichever you want. The only important part is that new content must be added in the `.pages` div, and `_uihooks` correctly bound.

## Installing and contributing

Just clone this repo and run the 'meteor' command. You should not need anything else !

Feel free to use, fork, edit... But this repo is not meant to become anything more than a test case !
